# Archivefiles
Very simple app for compressing files to 7zip format. Why would you want to use it? If you have many files in the same folder but you want to split them to separate 7z files you can quickly do that using command "-r/--regex file name keywords" instead of manually marking every file.

For a full list of commands type "-h/--help".

To compile it requires [7zip-cpp](https://github.com/getnamo/7zip-cpp) and [Lyra](https://github.com/bfgroup/Lyra).
